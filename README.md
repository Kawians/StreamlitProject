# StreamlitProject
we present the findings and outcomes of our image classification model developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. We have an interactive app where users can play the game against the computer by uploading an image of their hand gesture, and the model would predict the corresponding choice.<br>
The model was integrated into an app to provide an interactive gaming experience. Initially, our intention was to allow users to play the game using their webcam to capture their hand gestures in real-time. However, due to regulations and limitations regarding webcam usage, the app enable users to upload a picture of their hand gesture instead. Although this adjustment impacted the real-time aspect of the game, it still facilitated meaningful interactions with the model.<br>
It is important to note that our model's accuracy was influenced by the limitations imposed on uploading images. Consequently, we optimized our model to achieve the highest possible accuracy while ensuring the model size remained within the restrictions.<br>
Overall, our project successfully showcased the capabilities of image classification using CNNs <br>
Our image classification model demonstrated promising performance in predicting the hand gestures of rock, paper, and scissors when provided with uploaded images. While we faced limitations in implementing real-time webcam-based interactions, the app still offered an engaging user experience.
